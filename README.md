All DERO news and updates be will recorded here. 

#### ABOUT DERO PROJECT
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [DERO](https://github.com/deroproject/derosuite) is decentralized DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) based blockchain with enhanced reliability, privacy, security, and usability. Consensus algorithm is PoW based on [DERO AstroBWT: ASIC/FPGA/GPU resistant CPU mining algorithm ](https://github.com/deroproject/astrobwt). DERO is industry leading and the first blockchain to have bulletproofs, TLS encrypted Network.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DERO is the first crypto project to combine a Proof of Work blockchain with a DAG block structure and wholly anonymous transactions based on [CryptoNote Protocol](https://github.com/deroproject/documentation/blob/master/CryptoNote-WP.pdf). The fully distributed ledger processes transactions with a twenty-seven average block time and is secure against majority hashrate attacks. DERO will be the first fully private blockchain to have smart contracts on its native chain without any extra layers or secondary blockchains. At present DERO have Smart Contracts on [testnet](https://github.com/deroproject/documentation/blob/master/testnet/stargate.md) using CryptoNote Protocol.  

#### NB: In coming times DERO with full respect will migrate from CryptoNote Protocol to new [DHEBP Protocol based on Homomorphic Encryption](https://git.dero.io/Captain/DHEBP).

* Note-1 Realization of CryptoNote Protocol security and limitations in Smart Contracts. Started search for better protocol. 
* Note-2 Finally decided to write new protocol based on Homomorphic Encryption.  
* Note-3 Graviton was required for DERO Blockchain Homomorphic Encryption protocol.

#### DERO believes in security, stability and reliability. So it's better to write your own rather than compromising on any above mentioned aspects.
